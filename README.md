# GameScout https://game-scout.vercel.app/

This is a Game discovery platform like the popular RAWG.
For frontend I've used React 18 + Typescript.
And, for the backend I've used the API provided by rawg.io. You can find the API here: https://api.rawg.io/docs/
Finally, I've deployed my application on Vercel
